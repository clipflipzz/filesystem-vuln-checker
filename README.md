# Executor Vulnerability Test
This tests for vulnerabilities inside of roblox executors, including a lot of commonly exploited services and protection bypasses.
Most current tests are outdated due to Roblox API changes, this works perfectly as of right now.
This script is intended **ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF PATCHING SAID VULNERABILITIES.**
I am not responsible for the potential misuse.
